TLS-Libary
========================

This repository contains multiple libraries that model a transmission line, as
well as provide engineering calculations. Each library will typically have its
own subfolder to distinguish it from others.

GET INVOLVED!
This is an open source effort to create transmission line design software. This
software is released in the public domain (see UNLICENSE file), so we can
contribute to this collectively without worrying about intellectual property.

Existing software distributors are encouraged to contribute as well. With a 
consistent base functionality, software distributors can focus more on user 
interface improvements, which makes everyone happier as a whole.
