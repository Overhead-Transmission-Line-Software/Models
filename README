TLS-Libaries
========================

OVERVIEW
This repository contains multiple libraries that model a transmission line, as
well as provide engineering calculations. Each library has its own subfolder to
distinguish it from others.

GET INVOLVED!
This is an open source effort to create transmission line design software. This
software is released in the public domain (see UNLICENSE file), so we can
contribute to this collectively without worrying about intellectual property.
Existing software distributors are encouraged to contribute as well. With a 
consistent base modeling/calculation functionality, software distributors can
focus more on interface improvements, which makes users happier.

NATIVE C++ CODE
The code in this repository is not platform specific, as it will only contain
native C++ code. These libraries should be able to be built on any platform.

CODING STYLE
This project follows the Google style guidelines for C++ projects.
